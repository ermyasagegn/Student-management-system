# Student-management-system
I did this project in junior high, 11th grade. I just thought It might be useful for other people who wanted to work on related projects.

It basically is a student registration management system, I did it for the demo version, this is it. The objects you add (the students you register) here will not be on the system forever, but for the session. Because I did not use any database to store the files, but I used Javascript local API to store the lists just on that local page/file. Meaning, when the page is refreshed, the list will start over again, from zero.
